# Section 016: Session Lifecycle — Step 11: Code Review

## Review Method
Unlike the original pass (which reviewed source code by reading it), this review actually
**executed** the script in a simulated DOM (`tests/smoke.js`) and observed real behavior,
per the corrective process established in `bmad/sections/101-v7.1-bugfix-pass/`.

## Findings
**v7.1 FIX:** session elapsed-time tracking and DOM-based counters now correctly pause while `SessionFreeze.isFrozen()` is true (previously SessionFreeze didn't actually affect lifecycle tracking at all).

## Verdict
✅ **APPROVED (post-fix)** — `node --check` passes; module boots and runs without error;
public API behaves as documented as of 2026-07-27.
